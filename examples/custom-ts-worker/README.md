# next-pwa - custom worker example

[TOC]

This example demonstrates how to use `next-pwa` plugin to turn a `next.js` based web application into a progressive web application easily. It demonstrates how to add custom worker code to the service worker generated by workbox.

## New Method

Simply create a `worker/index.ts` and start implementing your service worker. `next-pwa` will detect this file automatically, and bundle the file into `dest` as `worker-*.js` using `webpack`. It's also automatically injected into `sw.js` generated.

In this way, you get benefit of code splitting and size minimization automatically. Yes! `require` modules works! Yes! you can share codes between web app and the service worker!

> - In dev mode, `worker/index.ts` is not watch, so it will not hot reload.

## Old Method (Still Works)

Basically you need to create a file such as `worker.js` in `public` folder, then add an option `importScripts` to `pwa` object in `next.config.js`:

``` javascript
const withPWA = require('next-pwa')

module.exports = withPWA({
  pwa: {
    dest: 'public',
    importScripts: ['/worker.js']
  }
})
```

Then service worker generated will automatically import your code and run it before other workbox code.
